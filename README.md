# Group4-FinalProject-PP-P2


**What the project does**

This project-based repository is exploring the relations between activity, situation, and overall context of the light and the interactions, user experiences and behaviour of your design’s potential users in a chosen design setting.
The project is a merging project between physical prototyping and programming 2 course of the Interaction Design Bachelor programme from Malmö University.

The chosen design setting for this particular repository is bike lights. 

**The presented code is based on:**
https://github.com/ClintH/interactivity



**Why the project is useful**

The project is exploring connectivity in relation to physical prototyping between an Arduino Kit, a computer and in some cases a phone.
The used ubicomp systems where designed based on a Serial Bridge and a Motion-Stream connection based on Clint Heyers Tutorials.
The code placed within this repository is useful for creating lo-fi interactivity prototypes with ubiquitous computing systems.


**What is the project exploring**

The project explores an intuitive way of interacting with bike lights and how to explore new ways of interacting as well as implementing new functionalities that are based upon user needs. 

- the given examples can be used as templates to implement interactive connectivity to arduino prototypes and to implement bike similiar        light behavior
- showing a simple approach to ubiquitous computing systems is useful for prototyping lo-fi data connection prototypes and to learn how to read data that has been parsed and transferred from cross device systems.

**How users can get started with the project:**

As this repository is based upon two different connectivity approaches one need to distinguish between the Serial-Bridge based code and the Motion-Stream code.

Before getting started please download and install the following onto your computer:
-
  
To get started with the Serial Bridge
```sh
<script src="../../build/annyang.min.js"></script>
<script src="main.js"></script>
```
The **annyang.min.js** can be placed in a separate folder if you are playing around with several examples.




To get started, link your **annyang.min.js** file in your index.html along with your **main.js**:
