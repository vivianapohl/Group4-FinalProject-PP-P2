**What the sketch does**

This example of the  motion stream shows how orientation data is send from a mobile device via websockets to a server. 
From there, the server distributes the received data to all connected clients.
The mobile device was implemented into a helmet. 
The second iterations: the screen from the localhost is divided into three parts to indicate more clearly the different ways the bike is moving. This is an example of how a bike lamp could work that indicates which way the bike is going.
This example emphasizes the gamma movement/degrees of the gyro.

**How users can get started with the project:**

(from Clint's ReadMe)

1. In the directory you've got this sample:

`$ npm install`

2. This will install the necessary packages from npm.

3.Once set up, you can boot up your server with

`$ npm start`

It will continue running. To stop it again, press CTRL+C (PC) or CMD+C (Mac).

4. Open the browser and type your ip-address + :8080. It will be blank until the mobile is connected.
   Eg. http://12.2.30.16:8080/

5. Open the browser in your mobile device and type your ip-address + :8080/mobile.html
   Eg. http://12.2.30.16:8080/mobile.html



**Architecture**

The demo consists of two bits : a mobile device and a server that receives data 

- the mobile device sends data via a websocket to a server.

- the localhost receives the date and is showing it
