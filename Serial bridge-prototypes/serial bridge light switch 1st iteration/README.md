**What the sketch does**
This sketch is exploring sending commands from a a localhost over a serialport to an Arduino to turn on/off an LED light


**How users can get started with the project:**
(from clints ReadMe)
1. Run `npm install`
2. Upload _Arduino\Arduino.ino_ to your Arduino
3. Open the serial monitor and ensure that you're getting occasional data from the Arduino. Once satisfied, close the monitor so the port is available again. If you're getting gibberish, double check to make sure the baud rate of the serial monitor is 115,200 (set in the Arduino sketch)
4. Start the Node.js sketch: `node app`. Since you didn't specify which serial port represents the Arduino, you'll get a list of ports displayed. Once you identify the right port, run it again with the port. On Windows this might be something like `node app com5` or on a Mac: `node app /dev/tty.usbmodem1411`. The port name is the often the same or similar to what shows up in the Arduino IDE.
5. Once started, you'll see the same periodic data showing up in the terminal, yay - data is being piped from the Arduino to browser land.
6. In your browser, open up `http://localhost:4000`. This will allow you to send commands to the Node.js server, which in turn forwards it to the Arduino. Likewise, messages sent by the Arduino are displayed in the web page.


**Architecture**

The demo consists of three bits: an Arduino sketch, a Node.js app, and a web app.

- The Arduino sketch sends/receives via serial over USB
- A Node.js app connects to the computer's serial port. It's a webserver with websockets enabled. When serial data is received from the Arduino, it broadcasts it to all clients connected via websockets. When data is received on the websocket, it sends it to the Arduino. You can open the connection to your Node.js server from any number of web browsers, including mobile devices!


**Serial commands**
1 for LED turn On
2 for LED turn Off
